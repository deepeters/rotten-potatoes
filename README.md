# Spring Cloud Microservices

## Introduction

Major difference between a monolith application and microservice is that in monolith architecture, the complexity is hidden within while in microservices complexity exists between the different microservices.

To manage the complexity in between microservices we can use:

- Patterns - make microservices work well together. Eg. Eureka for service discovery.
- Technologies - use libraries and frameworks to solve common problems.

Difference between microservice and webservices both referring to service oriented architecture.

- The difference refers to how the application is used. Web services are utilities meant to be reused in multiple unknown applications and therefore from thier development, an engineer has no idea how or where a webservice will be used.
- On the other hand, microservices are specific and during development engineers are very clear on where and how the microservice will be used. The intention with microservices is not on reusability.
